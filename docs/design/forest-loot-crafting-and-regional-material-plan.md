# Forest Loot, Crafting, Replay, and Regional Material Plan

- **Status:** Approved regional/economy design lock; Segments 1-5 implemented, Segments 6-8 pending. Decision 071 supersedes physical visible-weapon outputs with character-owned combat plus essence/relic equipment.
- **Approved:** 2026-07-26
- **Runtime coverage today:** Stages 1-5, six sparse/protected enemy profiles, thirteen illustrated materials, collectible pickups, profile-backed weapon/gear/material/recipe/claim state, Stage III and V milestone chests, six finalized Stage V equipment definitions/icons/recipes with live equip/stat authority, and Rootweaver Nema's atomic category/seal/material/output/save transaction
- **Planned content covered here:** Forest Stages 1-10 and a reusable foundation for Stage 11 onward

## Purpose

Battle of Gods must provide a reason to revisit completed stages beyond repeating the same fights for larger numbers. The approved long-term loop is:

```text
Fight -> Loot -> Craft -> Build -> Master -> Advance
```

First clears advance story and unlock content. Replays provide controlled material goals, Hunt variants, and milestone rewards. Sanctuary turns those rewards into deterministic equipment choices. Later regions reuse the same technical and visual grammar without collapsing into `Leather++` inventory clutter or cheap recolors.

This plan is intentionally broader than the three implemented stages so save data, item identities, folder ownership, icon production, monster design, and crafting authority do not need destructive rewrites when Stages 4-20 arrive.

## Decision 071 Equipment Overlay

The fight/loot/craft/replay structure and Stage III/V/VIII/X reward cadence remain approved. Decision 099 finalizes nine positions: Weapon Essence; Head, Plate, Gloves, and Boots armor; plus Bracer, Amulet, Ring, and Talisman accessories. These items modify a playable character's stats or authored traits without automatically replacing the character's visible signature weapon. Existing physical Ashwood/Iron runtime items remain migration dependencies until explicit aliases or a save conversion exist. `docs/design/king-character-roster-and-essence-redesign.md` owns that migration.

## Approved Product Rules

- Save/Continue is a prerequisite for loot and crafting. Grinding must never depend on keeping one application process open.
- Crafting starts deterministic. A recipe produces one known item with known stats; random affixes are deferred.
- Authored milestone chests never resolve empty; ordinary stages may bank collected enemy drops without a chest.
- First-clear progression rewards belong to authored milestones rather than every stage.
- Replays target roughly two to three useful clears per ordinary equipment piece, not long identical-run grinds.
- Bosses guarantee their unique crafting material.
- Crafted essences/relics improve survivability, expression, and margin for error. A later stage must remain technically beatable through mastery without enforcing an opaque hard gear wall.
- Difficulty must come from readable behaviors, combinations, armor-break opportunities, positioning, and elites rather than health inflation alone.
- Earlier regions retain limited material relevance, but new-region recipes primarily use current-region materials.
- Character level does not become an infinite raw-stat treadmill. Region caps may expand, while post-cap Mastery supplies bounded utility, crafting, cosmetic, title, or material benefits.
- Reward resolution, direct Stage I-II banking, the Stage III Reliquary, Stage V equipment/stats, and Rootweaver Nema's atomic crafting transaction are implemented. Hunts, Mastery, and Stages 6-20 are not implemented.

## First-Clear and Replay Loop

### First clear

1. Complete the authored encounter.
2. Bank collected drops directly on an ordinary stage or open its authored milestone chest.
3. Receive any milestone-specific permanent seal, discovery, catalyst, or guaranteed material payout.
4. Record the clear in story/profile state.
5. Unlock the next route and the cleared stage's replay/Hunt entry.

### Replay clear

1. Select a previously cleared stage or an authored Hunt variant from Sanctuary.
2. Complete the normal or modified encounter.
3. Retain collected protected enemy drops and any repeatable milestone payout.
4. Roll only the authored optional secondary/rare rewards.
5. Apply bad-luck protection where a material is required by a recipe.

### Hunt variants

Hunts reuse a stage deliberately rather than rerunning an identical campaign scene. Candidate modifiers include:

- Elite enemy replacement
- Rootstorm or other region hazard
- Increased ranged pressure
- Limited regeneration
- Boss-remnant encounter
- Bonus chest objective
- Restricted recovery window

No daily timer, advertisement loop, or real-money loot-box structure is approved.

## Current Enemy Drop Direction

These names and region-prefixed stable IDs are now approved through their `MaterialDefinition` resources. Initial quantities remain balance-tunable until reward and crafting playtests, but their identity and purpose are locked.

| Implemented enemy | Material identity | Crafting direction |
|---|---|---|
| Mireling | Mire Resin; Mire Membrane | Regeneration, status resistance, flexible footwear |
| Rootling | Root Fiber; Young Heartwood | Bindings, gloves, beginner protective pieces |
| Forsaken Thrall | Forsaken Cloth; Weathered Fittings | Armor lining and weapon fittings |
| Bramble Spitter | Barbed Seed; Thorn Sap | Thorn/critical identity and ranged-pressure resistance |
| Rootbound Husk | Husk Heartwood; Rootbound Core | Reinforced Forest equipment and rare recipes |

Leather is not assigned arbitrarily to a creature without a visible hide identity. The implemented Stage 4 Armored Hog now supplies the first true hide and bark-plate inputs. Stages 1-3 instead support rootfiber wraps, cloth equipment, charms, and weapon components.

## Provisional Forest Stage 4-10 Content Skeleton

The later roles and material purposes below remain planning slots rather than final names or approved enemy art. Stage 4's eastern-decay level, 6/8/10/12/14-enemy pressure sequence, Armored Hog, Hide, and Living Bark Plate are implemented; recipes consuming those two materials remain future work.

| Stage | New enemy/content role | Material purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | Armored hide-bearing Forest beast | Hide and bark plates for leather armor |
| 5 | Medium boss milestone, potentially extending the insect/swarm role | Permanent core-gear crafting seal plus repeatable catalyst |
| 6 | Forest caster/support | Spirit sap, rune fragments, and first accessory components/blueprints |
| 7 | Heavy corrupted brute or mini-boss | Dense heartwood plus binding/setting components for heavy gear and accessories |
| 8 | Fungal/spirit mini-boss milestone | Permanent standard-accessory seal plus repeatable fungal/spirit catalyst |
| 9 | Elite Forest warden/hunter | Refined fittings and advanced Forest recipes |
| 10 | Major Forest boss | Permanent relic/signature-accessory crafting seal plus repeatable unique catalyst |

Known enemies continue appearing in authored combinations. Aim for roughly one important new family every one or two stages, then remix existing roles. Do not replace the full roster every stage.

### Forest crafting tiers

- **Stages 1-3:** collect and inspect root, mire, cloth, thorn, and Husk preparation materials; no recipe unlock is granted yet
- **Stage 4:** implemented environment/crowd-pressure route plus Armored Hog hide-bearing ecology and protected materials; leather recipes remain future work
- **Stage 5:** permanently unlock core crafting for Weapon Essence plus Head, Plate, Gloves, and Boots; consume a repeatable boss catalyst in relevant recipes
- **Stages 6-7:** expand spirit, reinforced armor, axe/greatsword, and standard-accessory components/blueprints
- **Stage 8:** permanently unlock standard accessories and award a repeatable fungal/spirit/binding catalyst
- **Stage 9:** refine Forest fittings and advanced preparation
- **Stage 10:** permanently unlock relic/signature-accessory crafting and supply the repeatable signature catalyst

A crafting seal is permanent progression and is never consumed. A catalyst is repeatable inventory material and may be consumed by deterministic recipes. Decision 101 locks Stage V to Varkuun Edge, Old Bark Helm, Heartwood Plate, Rootfiber Gloves, Mirebound Leggings, and Mirehide Boots; their exact costs and stat budgets live in `docs/design/stage-5-core-equipment-set.md`. Mireward Charm and Thornward Clasp remain Stage VIII previews. Decision 101 preserves later accessories as Bracer, Amulet, Ring, and Talisman; their final mappings and stat budgets remain unimplemented.

Stage V's six recipes and item names are locked by Decisions 100-101 and craftable under Decision 120. Stage 6-10 enemy/item names remain open until their individual content contracts are approved. Stage 4's Armored Hog, Hide, Living Bark Plate, stats, and drop rates remain locked by its implemented contract.

## Monster Content Contract

Every new recurring monster requires an approved contract before bulk art or runtime implementation:

1. Narrative and ecological identity
2. Combat role, telegraph, and counterplay
3. Stage introduction and later reuse
4. Silhouette, pixel dimensions, palette, and lighting
5. Animation list, direction rows, cell sizes, safe margins, and frame counts
6. Movement collision, hurtbox, attack shape, navigation footprint, and occlusion needs
7. Controller state ownership and reusable components
8. Audio identity and legal provenance
9. Common, secondary, rare, elite, or boss drops
10. Recipes and stats supported by those drops
11. Portrait/profile requirement
12. Focused regression and performance coverage

Visible biology must support loot identity. Bark-plate drops require visible armor-like bark; venom requires a readable gland, sac, sting, or attack; fungal thread requires fungal or mycelial anatomy. A material may not be attached after the fact merely to fill a recipe.

## Material-Family Visual Grammar

The project uses a small reusable visual language instead of creating every icon from zero or relabeling indistinguishable recolors.

### Approved icon families

- Vial: venom, acid, oil, holy water, liquid essence
- Hide: ordinary hide, barkhide, scaled hide, frost hide
- Fiber bundle: root fiber, silk, mycelial thread, spectral thread
- Plate/chitin: bark plate, insect chitin, volcanic shell
- Ore/fitting: iron scrap, warden fitting, divine alloy
- Seed/crystal: barbed seed, frost seed, ember crystal
- Core: Rootbound Core, later regional cores
- Relic: unique boss and story materials

### Reuse levels

1. **Exact reuse:** a universal material remains the same item and ID across regions, such as Leather, Cloth, Iron Fittings, or Binding Thread.
2. **Template reuse:** the approved silhouette/container is reused, but the substance, internal cluster, palette, glyph, and final texture differ. Mire Venom and future Corrosive Acid may share a vial family without becoming the same icon.
3. **Original silhouette:** boss hearts, divine relics, story key items, and physically unique materials receive dedicated art.

Text labels are data and are never painted into material icons. Rarity frames belong to UI presentation rather than the item bitmap. Important differences use silhouette, internal shape, glyph, or pattern and never depend on color alone.

### Venom/acid example

| Property | Forest venom | Future corrosive acid |
|---|---|---|
| Family | Vial | Vial |
| Container | Shared approved silhouette | Shared approved silhouette |
| Substance | Thick drops | Bubbling corrosive fluid |
| Identity mark | Fang/leaf | Corrosion/hazard |
| Tags | Poison, thorn, critical | Corrosion, armor break, resistance |
| Final runtime file | Separate PNG | Separate PNG |
| Display label | Resource data | Resource data |

Templates support deterministic generation, but each approved material receives a flattened final runtime PNG and a separate data resource. Runtime shaders must not recolor one generic icon into every material.

## Cross-Region Material Rules

Stage 11 onward reuses the grammar and some universal materials, not the entire Forest economy.

- Ordinary later-region recipes should use roughly 20-30% universal or older materials and 60-70% current-region materials, with an occasional elite/boss catalyst.
- Old boss materials appear only in special cross-region upgrades, never every recipe.
- Higher-region materials differ by function and ecology, not names such as `Leather+`, `Leather++`, `Strong Leather`, or `Super Leather`.
- Examples of meaningful variants include Barkhide, Acid-Sealed Hide, Scaled Hide, and Spectral Hide.
- A future region may reuse an enemy animation contract or technical behavior composition, but a regional creature variant requires distinct readable anatomy, attack behavior, telegraph/VFX, audio layer, drop profile, and `SpriteFrames` resource. Palette-only enemy swaps are insufficient.

The Stage 11-20 region theme, exact acid/corrosion use, and final material roster remain open. The data/art grammar is locked now so that choice does not require new infrastructure.

## Implemented Segments 2-3 Contracts

The following immutable contracts and responsibility boundaries are implemented. Segment 3 grants their authored rewards; no contract crafts an output.

### `MaterialDefinition`

- Stable `material_id`
- Display name and description
- Region ID
- Material family
- Grade/rarity metadata
- 24x24 runtime icon
- Crafting tags
- Optional source-lore metadata

### `DropProfileDefinition`

- Percentage-based common material entries
- Optional secondary entries
- Rare entries
- Quantity ranges
- Elite/boss guarantees
- Bad-luck-protection key where required

Enemy controllers do not calculate or roll loot.

### `LootTableDefinition`

- Stage/region identity
- First-clear guarantees
- Replay guarantees
- Optional rolls
- Blueprint/discovery/key-material entries
- Protection rules

Stage UI and chest presentation do not roll rewards themselves.

### `RecipeDefinition`

- Stable recipe ID
- Output equipment/material ID and quantity
- Required material IDs and quantities
- Unlock requirement
- Region/tier metadata
- Crafting category
- Deterministic result

### Runtime authorities

- `MaterialInventory`: implemented mutable known-material quantities with a versioned snapshot
- `RecipeDiscovery`: implemented known-recipe IDs in a dedicated versioned snapshot, separate from `StoryState`
- `LootState`: implemented first-clear claim IDs and bad-luck miss counters in a dedicated versioned snapshot
- `LootService`: implemented enemy/stage table resolution, validated material grants, expedition reward baselines, and reward observation signals
- `CraftingService`: implemented validation of unlocks/costs/unique outputs and atomic spend/grant/save transactions
- Existing equipment inventory/stat authorities: own crafted equipment and equip state
- `SaveService`: serializes explicit snapshots from progression, story, equipment, materials, recipes, and safe-location state
- UI: observes definitions/state and submits requests only

## Rootweaver Sanctuary Role

The approved crafting role is now implemented as **Rootweaver Nema**, an attractive adult female grove smith with a west-mid open-air Living Rootforge. Her compact screen-left three-quarter actor follows Eira and Orren's Sanctuary proportions while the portrait, auburn hair, forge apron, root hammer, tongs, and approved visible-arm work silhouette carry the adult character identity. Earlier realistic, elderly, and front-facing boards remain provenance only. `docs/design/rootweaver-nema-sanctuary-service-proposal.md` records the accepted identity, runtime package, dialogue, placement, and atomic crafting contract.

The role must remain distinct from Orren:

- Orren currently sells/equips ordinary authored weapons and may later sell or temper simple mortal essences after migration.
- The Rootweaver transforms creature/region materials through deterministic recipes.

Segment 4 delivers:

- Character identity and narrative relationship
- Workshop placement and traversable footprint
- Opaw-scale sprite contract and named `AnimatedSprite2D` states
- 96x96 portrait/profile asset
- Dialogue and crafting interaction
- Tool/idle sounds plus attribution
- Crafting UI responsibilities

`RootforgeMenu` observes recipe/category discovery, seal ownership, material readiness, and unique output ownership. It delegates to the implemented atomic `CraftingService`, which coordinates the existing material, weapon/gear, and safe-profile authorities without allowing UI-owned mutation.

## Level, Gear, and Mastery Direction

- Current Forest development remains bounded by the authored Level 1-10 curve.
- Later regions may expand the character cap in controlled bands rather than enabling infinite raw-stat scaling.
- Post-cap Mastery may be uncapped only if rewards stay bounded: crafting efficiency, material bonuses, titles, cosmetics, discoveries, or small capped utility.
- Varkuun Edge is targeted for Stages VI-XV. Stage VI must remain freely enterable without crafted ownership, while its new campaign enemies make starter-gear clears intentionally slower and riskier; Mirelings/Rootlings stay in earlier/replay content rather than the new roster.
- Stage 11 should be balanced around partial Forest equipment, not require a complete perfect set.
- An expert player with incomplete gear should retain a viable path through readable mastery.

Exact regional caps, final character cap, Mastery categories, and reward percentages remain open.

## Asset and Folder Contract

Planned organization:

```text
art_source/generated/items/materials/templates/
assets/items/materials/common/
assets/items/materials/forest/
assets/items/materials/<future_region>/
data/items/materials/common/
data/items/materials/forest/
data/items/materials/<future_region>/
data/loot/forest/
data/loot/<future_region>/
data/crafting/recipes/forest/
data/crafting/recipes/<future_region>/
```

- Material wallet/list icons use native 24x24 pixel art.
- Detailed equipment portraits retain the approved 64x64 contract.
- Generated assets retain source board, cleaned/intermediate material where needed, deterministic processor, final runtime PNG, and import metadata.
- Character sheets follow `docs/design/character-animation-pixel-contract.md`.
- Final recurring actors expose named `SpriteFrames` on `AnimatedSprite2D`.
- Audio must be original, CC0, or clearly license-compatible; exact provenance belongs in `assets/audio/ATTRIBUTION.md`.
- Never rip art/audio from another game or bulk-import an unreviewed pack.
- Superseded runtime code/assets are reference-checked, then removed or preserved under Godot-ignored `art_source/archive/` only when they retain real source value.

## Segmented Implementation Order

### Segment 0 - Design lock

- This document, ADR, sources of truth, folder contracts
- No runtime feature claims

### Segment 1 - Save/Continue — implemented

- **Completed 2026-07-29:** one safe-point profile, atomic temporary writes, rotating backup/recovery, title Continue/New Journey protection, and isolated persistence tests
- Versioned profile schema
- Continue/New Journey
- Safe-point autosave, temporary write, backup/recovery
- Snapshot/migration/corruption tests

### Segment 2 - Material and crafting data — implemented

- **Completed 2026-07-29:** stable material, material-stack, drop-entry, drop-profile, loot-table, and recipe Resources plus validated global catalogs
- Authored ten current-enemy materials, five enemy profiles, the retained Stage III milestone table, and four deterministic starter recipe blueprints; superseded Stage I-II tables were removed when those stages adopted direct banking
- Added versioned `MaterialInventory` and `RecipeDiscovery` snapshots through the reserved profile extensions, including legacy-empty compatibility
- At Segment 2 completion, added no reward resolution, chest/Rootweaver art, or crafting output; Segment 3 subsequently consumes these definitions.
- **Character & Bag preparation completed 2026-07-29:** real nonzero material stacks are inspectable through a capacity-free material pouch in the shared 24-slot inventory presentation; Segment 3 now supplies final current icons and the normal acquisition path.

### Segment 3 - Loot and milestone rewards — implemented

- **Completed 2026-07-29:** enemy drop-profile integration through centralized `LootService`, collectible world pickups, and compact HUD confirmation
- Sparse ordinary common/secondary percentage rolls with sixth/twelfth-attempt protection caps; guaranteed boss rewards include both Husk Heartwood and Rootbound Core
- Hop/hover presentation plus delayed magnetic auto-collection, retaining contact as a fallback
- Direct clear banking and portal creation for Stages I-II; explicit `F` interaction, collision, Y-sorting, spawn reveal, and Rootbound Reliquary presentation for the Stage III milestone
- Versioned idempotent first-clear claims plus expedition rollback before defeat/abandon and commit before stage-clear autosave in both completion modes
- Ten distinct flattened 24x24 Forest icons with preserved source/clean/review boards
- Focused protection, duplicate-grant, persistence, rollback, chest, stage-wiring, and icon tests

### Segment 4 - Rootweaver production

- Approved identity, portrait, sprite sheets, `SpriteFrames`, workshop, interaction, sound

### Segment 5 - Crafting experience

- Crafting service and deterministic transaction UI
- First Forest recipes and equipment/stat integration

### Segment 6 - Replay Hunts

- Cleared-stage selection, authored modifiers, replay rewards

### Segment 7 - Stage 4-10 content

- Approve each monster content contract before art/runtime work
- Preserve the Stage V core-gear seal, Stage VIII standard-accessory seal, and Stage X relic/signature seal cadence
- Stage 10 boss and signature Forest craft

### Segment 8 - Stage 11 and next region

- Approve region identity
- Reuse material grammar with new ecology, variants, and recipes
- Expand cap/Mastery only through a separate balance decision

Each segment requires focused tests, full regression validation, relevant documentation updates, asset review, attribution, and removal/archive of superseded active-runtime material.

## Intentionally Open Choices

These are not blockers for Save/Continue, but must be approved before their owning segment:

- Rootweaver's final name, design, personality, workshop, and lore
- Final starter-equipment stats and recipe quantity tuning after crafting becomes playable
- Exact Stage V/VIII/X boss identities, permanent seal/catalyst names and IDs, quantities, and first-clear presentation
- Stage 4-10 monster names, visuals, behavior timing, and encounter composition
- Stage 10 boss identity
- Stage 11-20 biome/region theme
- Exact regional level-cap expansion
- Mastery categories and percentages
- Hunt modifier list and reward multipliers

Future work must not silently resolve these choices while implementing a lower segment.
