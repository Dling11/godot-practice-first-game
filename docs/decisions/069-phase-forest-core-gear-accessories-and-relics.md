# Decision 069: Phase Forest Core Gear, Accessories, and Relics Across Stages V-X

- **Status:** Accepted; progression contract planned, later-stage content not implemented
- **Date:** 2026-08-01

## Context

Unlocking every accessory only after the Stage X regional boss would make the new build layer arrive when the Forest campaign is already finished. Unlocking it beside the first core equipment would crowd Stage V and weaken later milestones. The current Character & Bag layout also has two generic accessory positions, while proposed names such as bracer, earring, pendant, charm, ring, and relic overlap unless item families are separated from equipment slots.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Unlock weapons, armor, gloves, boots, accessories, and relics together at Stage V.
2. Keep all accessories and relics sealed until Stage X.
3. Unlock core gear at Stage V, introduce accessory components in Stages VI-VII, unlock standard accessories at Stage VIII, and reserve relic/signature crafting for Stage X.

## Decision

Choose option 3.

Stage V permanently unlocks the Forest core-gear category: weapons, chest armor, gloves/bracers, and boots. Bracers are an item family for the gloves slot rather than an additional paper-doll slot.

Stages VI-VII introduce spirit, rune, binding, and setting components plus discoverable standard-accessory blueprints, but do not fabricate an equipable accessory before its seal exists. Stage VIII's mini-boss grants the first permanent standard-accessory seal and a repeatable catalyst. Mireward Charm and Thornward Clasp move to this milestone. Stage X grants the permanent relic/signature-accessory seal and the Forest's unique repeatable catalyst.

The paper doll retains two generic accessory positions. Pendant/amulet, earring, ring/charm, and similar standard families may occupy either position unless a future build-system decision requires explicit left/right restrictions. Relics use the same positions but remain Stage X content; the UI must not grow a separate slot for every jewelry noun.

Initial standard-accessory stats may use only implemented or explicitly added stat authorities: capped maximum vitality, regeneration modifiers, dash recovery, skill cooldown, or resistance after a resistance system exists. Earrings may support mana efficiency only after mana authority exists. Critical chance, lifesteal, mana, status application, and loot bonuses must not be faked in item copy before their systems exist. Relics should eventually favor bounded conditional passives over unbounded raw damage.

## Consequences

- Stages I-V establish the visible core equipment fantasy without overloading the first crafting milestone.
- Stages VI-VIII introduce a new build objective before the Forest ends.
- Stage X remains meaningful through relics and signature effects rather than withholding all accessories.
- Two generic accessory slots keep Character & Bag readable and prevent paper-doll bloat.
- Segment 5 must still implement atomic crafting and real core-gear outputs first; this decision does not claim Stage VI-X content is playable.
- Decision 067 remains authoritative for sparse drops, Stage III, permanent seals, and repeatable catalysts; this decision supersedes its former Stage X first-accessory unlock.
