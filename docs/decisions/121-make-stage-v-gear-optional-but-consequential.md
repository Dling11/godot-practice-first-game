# Decision 121: Make Stage V Gear Optional but Consequential

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-22

## Context

The first crafted set must matter before production proceeds to Stage VI. A hard rule such as "equip Varkuun Edge to enter" would remove player freedom, while the previous small numerical upgrade allowed players to ignore crafting without feeling a meaningful combat difference. The set also lacked durable slot identities, and percentage bonuses needed explicit bounds before later gear could stack them.

## Alternatives

1. Hard-gate Stage VI behind owning or equipping Varkuun Edge.
2. Keep the prior small upgrade and let Stage VI remain close to the starter balance.
3. Permit every loadout, but tune new encounters so crafted gear materially reduces clear time and danger.

## Decision

Choose Alternative 3.

- Stage VI and later stages do not check equipment ownership for entry. King's starter equipment remains legal.
- Do not weaken King's existing unequipped baseline to manufacture an upgrade. Stage VI earns its difficulty through tougher, harder-hitting, readable new enemies.
- Mirelings and Rootlings remain valid in their implemented early stages and future replay content, but the new Stage VI campaign roster does not use them.
- Varkuun Edge is targeted as a useful Stages VI-XV weapon: 16-20 Basic Hit, 38 Skill Power, 8% critical chance, 150% critical damage, and King's unchanged 0.59-second attack cycle/reach.
- Roll critical chance once per basic swing or skill strike. Every target accepted by that activation shares the result, and a critical hit receives explicit gold `CRIT` feedback.
- Old Bark Helm grants +50 maximum health and +2 health/second; Heartwood Plate grants +30 armor; Rootfiber Gloves grant +15% basic-attack speed; Mirebound Leggings grant +90 maximum health; Mirehide Boots grant +15% grounded movement speed.
- Slot identities are Weapon = damage/skill power/critical/later uniques, Head = regeneration plus moderate health, Plate = armor, Gloves = attack speed, Leggings = primary health, and Boots = movement. Higher grades may mix secondary stats without erasing those identities.
- Cap aggregated attack-speed bonus at 50%, grounded movement-speed bonus at 35%, and critical chance at 50%.
- A Stage XV-era lifesteal weapon is a future unique-effect direction, not implemented authority.
- Character & Bag and the Living Rootforge use compact native-viewport layouts, concise equipped-item comparisons, and small right-edge formula silhouettes so item type does not depend on reading names.

## Consequences

- Skilled players may intentionally skip crafting, but they accept longer fights and greater incoming-damage risk rather than encountering an artificial lock.
- Stage VI needs a dedicated content contract and two-loadout playtest measuring clear time and damage taken before its enemy health/damage values are final.
- Varkuun Edge should eventually be replaced by a real higher-tier weapon around Stage XV rather than scaling indefinitely.
- Percentage caps are runtime guarantees and must remain shared by equipment aggregation and combat/movement consumers.
