# Architecture

This document records current production ownership. Detailed historical migrations live in `docs/decisions/` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Runtime Composition

- Decision 148's `levels/combat_lab/king_spellward_review.gd` owns an opt-in presentation comparison, not a second player controller. It snapshots/restores the body's script/frames/scale/material, installs the preview-only animation subclass and one-texel outline, and preserves signal bindings. Stagger hold/release observes Player authority. Local speed samples call bounded component setters without editing gear resources; actual equipment changes return the sample to gear mode. The normal Lab scene path and reward/save boundaries remain intact.

- `Player` is the sole authority for King movement, facing, attack requests, dash, constraints, and skill dispatch.
- Spellward's preview-only animation subclass preserves normalized stride phase between its eight-frame side and four-frame front/back walk clips. Frame rates retain one cycle period; movement speed still comes from Player and equipment components.
- `tools/build_king_side_leg_cycle.gd` renders generated thigh/shin/boot sprites with a two-bone solve into the side atlas offline, beneath locked approved upper-body frames. Runtime still uses ordinary SpriteFrames; there is no gameplay IK or procedural movement authority. The earlier whole-body builder produces normalized source only, preventing an accidental rollback of the final atlas.
- Components own isolated state machines: melee, evade, abilities, health, progression, equipment aggregation, interaction, assisted targeting, and optional auto combat.
- Immutable `.tres` definitions own balance/content data. Runtime state belongs to nodes or profile-backed autoloads, never shared resources.
- Presentation nodes observe accepted events. Animation, VFX, audio, HUD, cursor, target markers, and hitstop never decide damage, movement, cooldown, rewards, or persistence.

## Economy and material memory

- `MaterialDefinition` owns immutable exchange metadata: source enemy, rarity, sale/meld values, reconstruction costs and memory thresholds, catalyst overrides, and protection flags. `is_reconstruction_target()` excludes Common rarity centrally, so future ordinary drops remain fuel/sale resources without Umi-specific IDs. `material_catalog.tres` is the only list Umi reads.
- `EnemyDefinition.enemy_id` supplies the stable defeat key. `EnemyRewardComponent` records ordinary defeats; the Stage V claim flow records Varkuun after the milestone is actually secured.
- `EnemyMemory` owns defeat counts and spent ten-victory boss-memory charges. `SaveService` persists it as a backward-compatible extension and New Journey resets it.
- `MaterialExchangeService` is the sole sell/reconstruct transaction coordinator. It validates catalog identity, inventory, memory, catalysts, points, and gold; snapshots material/coin/memory state; mutates once; saves once; and restores every snapshot on failure.
- `MaterialInventory` separates strict creation from saturating loot collection. `add_material*` rejects overflow for paid/service transactions, while `collect_material*` clamps valid earned loot to `MAX_MATERIAL_QUANTITY` and reports accepted versus overflow quantities. `LootService` alone uses the saturating path, allowing `MaterialPickup` cleanup and stage-chest progression at a full stack; HUD presentation receives the actual accepted quantity plus cap state. Umi checks strict output capacity before any spend.
- `CraftingService` similarly includes `RecipeDefinition.gold_cost` in its existing material/output/save transaction. `RunSession` is the durable coin authority and live `PlayerProgressionComponent` mirrors its progression signal.
- `UmiExchangeMenu` and `RootforgeMenu` display authority results but do not calculate or mutate inventory ownership directly.
- Umi's 48x48 side-facing world animation, native-density 96x96 dialogue portrait, and 72x64 lateral Echo Crucible workbench are separate derivatives. The workbench scene owns a narrow physical footprint and layers a small presentation-only pulse/orbit over the right-hand bowl that Umi faces.

## Input and Assisted Combat

- `PlayerInputSource` converts keyboard, mouse, and controller events into intent.
- `PlayerCombatTargetingComponent` owns an optional living target, selection query, target signals, pursuit intent, and size-aware approach distance. It does not move or attack.
- Right click always starts navigation movement and clears target, pursuit, optional automation, and repeated-click state. WASD clears the same combat intent.
- A world left click first cancels navigation movement and optional automation. One enemy click selects only; a repeated same-actor click inside the bounded time/position window engages; empty ground requests a directional air swing.
- Selection queries enemy hurtboxes first, then the physical enemy `CharacterBody2D` footprint with an eight-pixel `CircleShape2D` assist.
- Assisted approach stops at `player footprint + EnemyDefinition.movement_footprint_radius + padding`; the real `MeleeHitbox` remains the only normal-attack contact authority.
- Held WASD cancels pursuit and selection. Dash, restraints, targeted previews, and active/recovery commitments retain priority.
- `AutoCombatComponent` cycles living enemies and requests ordinary attacks/skills through the same Player APIs and cooldown rules. Manual world left-click or right-click ground disables it.

## Combat

- `MeleeAttackComponent` owns wind-up, active, recovery, attack buffering boundary, and hitbox activation.
- `AbilityComponent` and narrow King-specific subclasses own cast phases, target snapshots, movement requests, strike windows, invulnerability requests, and cooldowns.
- `HealthComponent` accepts `DamageInfo`, resolves armor/control profile, and emits accepted results. Long-lived projectiles validate their stored source before constructing damage so an already-freed shooter becomes `null` rather than an invalid typed Object.
- `HostileProjectile` owns travel, range/lifetime cleanup, player/world collision, and impact spawning. `CounterableHostileProjectile` composes a one-health `HurtboxComponent`; `selectable_as_combat_target = false` keeps the projectile out of assisted targeting/rosters while existing player hitboxes can destroy it through the normal damage pipeline.
- `KnockbackComponent` and actor controllers cooperate so each body remains its own movement authority. `StaggerComponent` independently resolves duration scaling, a configurable rapid-interrupt chain, and a temporary breakout window; it never owns damage or feedback. Light enemies remain freely interruptible, Elite/Heavy profiles reduce control, and Boss profiles reject it. Player composes the same knockback/stagger observers but remains the only authority that cancels its vulnerable attack/cast, applies incoming push velocity, and gates input during brief recovery. Ability data may declare super armor without changing damage acceptance.
- `CombatFeedbackPresenter` observes accepted hits for flash, numbers, sparks, camera response, sound, and presentation-only hitstop.
- King loads `data/weapons/king_signature_sword.tres` and `data/skills/king_starting_loadout.tres`: Echoing Sever, Riftbreak, Sovereign Pursuit, and Worldsplitter.
- `WeaponDefinition` owns bounded critical chance/damage data. `MeleeHitbox` rolls once when a basic swing or skill strike activates and carries the shared result in every `DamageInfo` emitted by that activation; multi-target cleaves therefore cannot roll independently per victim. `AbilityComponent` receives the equipped weapon profile before cast, while feedback only observes `DamageInfo.is_critical`.
- `MeleeAttackComponent` and `PlayerMovementComponent` clamp aggregated equipment bonuses at 50% attack speed and 35% movement speed. Weapon definitions clamp critical chance at 50%; no UI or save data may bypass those runtime caps.

## Enemy Footprints and Navigation

- `EnemyDefinition.movement_footprint_radius` owns physical underfoot size; `crowd_separation_radius` independently owns spacing.
- `EnemyFootprintSystem` synchronizes movement collision, `NavigationAgent2D.radius`, and optional separation detection.
- Hurtboxes and attack shapes remain separately authored; visible foot auras observe tier/radius and do not replace collision.
- Stage flows own spawn caps and reinforcement timing. Stages I-III preserve four live enemies, Stage IV permits eight, and Stage III keeps Rootbound Husk solo.
- `EncounterWaveDefinition.spawn_entries` composes future enemies through `EncounterSpawnEntryDefinition` scene-plus-count resources; legacy named count fields remain only for backward-compatible Stages I-IV data. Stage VI uses generic entries and a five-active-enemy cap.
- Frame-authored enemy presentation belongs to an `AnimatedSprite2D` plus named `SpriteFrames`; the enemy state machine emits authoritative phases while visual observers select frame spans. Crag Bear and Bramble Spitter both follow this seam. Tweens may enhance spawn/flash/recoil but cannot substitute for missing attack poses. Correct native opaque-pixel bounds in source processing rather than compensating for a wrong gameplay silhouette with permanent scene-node scale.

## UI and Presentation

- `CombatHUD` binds to player health/progression/actions and observes the current target. It owns no gameplay mutation beyond forwarding explicit button requests.
- The enemy roster forwards target/auto requests and displays health/tier information only after visible actors enter discovery range. `MarqueeLabel` clips/pads every name and animates only real overflow; a roster signature prevents quarter-second row reconstruction from restarting that presentation.
- `CombatTargetMarker` uses the small selected chevron; `CombatFootAura` communicates footprint/tier.
- `CursorService` owns normal, interactive, attack-target, and skill-confirm cursor presentation.
- The six `AtlasTexture` action icons share `assets/ui/icons/combat/combat_action_atlas_bc_6x1_24.png` in fixed Skills 1-4, Basic Attack, Dodge/Dash order.
- `CharacterMenu` observes King equipment/material/skill state. Its compact slot detail compares a selected item with the currently equipped definition. `RootforgeMenu` places a small output icon at the right of every formula row, including a locked-box icon for sealed previews; these icons and comparison labels are presentation only. Ultimate and Reality Breaking are disabled previews with no input, ability, cooldown, unlock, or save authority.

## Sanctuary and Stages

- `SanctuaryFlow` composes dialogue, expedition selection, Character & Bag, Eira's skill information, Orren dialogue, and Nema's Living Rootforge. `RootforgeMenu` observes readiness and delegates mutation to `CraftingService`; that service validates the canonical recipe/category/seal/cost/unique-output contract, coordinates `MaterialInventory` with `WeaponInventory` or `GearInventory`, and requests `SaveService` only after successful in-memory mutation. Any failed step restores pre-transaction snapshots. Sanctuary entry separately restores King to current maximum health before its ordinary safe-point write.
- The retired weapon shop and skill-awakening transaction are not runtime dependencies.
- Stage flows own dialogue gates, wave completion, reward/chest milestones, and transitions. They delegate reward calculation to loot services and persistence to save authorities.
- `Stage6Flow` starts and binds the production encounter, records `forest_stage_6_cleared` plus `elder_ascent`, requests the safe-point save after banking, and leaves portal creation to `EncounterController`. Crag Bear owns its chase/basic/slam state machine; its visual maps wind-up/active/recovery to eight body-authored frames and uses taller action-cell anchors without moving the actor root. Hitbox activation stays synchronized to contact phases, while its reward component delegates the drop profile to shared loot authority. `CragBearActionAudio` and `CragBearImpactPresenter` only observe those state transitions: the former delays/cancels the rise growl safely, while the latter places a short-lived `CragBearSlamImpactVfx` at the radial hitbox in `World/Effects`. Camera response routes through `CombatFeedbackPresenter.request_camera_pulse()` so simultaneous enemy presenters do not compete for camera offset.
- Authored `TileMapLayer` data and environment scenes own collision/navigation/occlusion; runtime-random terrain generation is not production authority. `AuthoredGroundLayout.empty_tile_keys` may deliberately omit cells for a canyon or water reveal, but explicit physics and navigation geometry—not texture alpha or a missing cell—owns traversability. Stage VI composes its continuous approved ground, modular top-down cliff textures, existing tree scenes, rock props, and a presentation-only animated-waterfall scene beneath one explicit upper-cliff collision owner; it has no scenic backdrop dependency.
- Future stage data composes reusable actor, projectile, VFX, audio, material, and environment scenes by canonical identity. Introduction stage is encounter metadata, not asset ownership. A Disciple, Mage, Stone Warden, or Crag Bear may return later without duplicating or renaming its core scene.

## Story and Choice Ownership

- `STORY_BIBLE.md` owns canonical premise and open lore; `docs/design/divine-game-story-roadmap.md` owns internal spoilers and planned Stage VII/IX/XX anchors; `docs/design/disciples-of-the-one-above-visual-contract.md` owns Examiner/Executioner identity, scale, animation, weapon, and reusable-folder direction. None is runtime authority.
- `StoryState` owns stable occurred-event, discovery, victory, and narrative-key state. Dialogue text, speaker portraits, and localization remain presentation data and must not be parsed as progression conditions.
- A future Stage XX flow must own the required scenario entry, safe-point boundary, victory/defeat handling, any power reward, and onward transition. The Examiner controller owns combat behavior only; `DialoguePanel`, portal presentation, Split Glaive secondary layers, VFX, and health UI cannot decide the story result.
- Decision 136 (2026-09-12) rebuilds the rewardless F7 Examiner proof with ten eight-column `192x160` sheets, 116 named clips, disjoint anticipation/contact spans, original action/footstep audio, an engraved-slate Court, exact traversable cyan wards, compact review controls, and actual phase/technique text. Grounded charge now stops at physical collision. Body baseline is 128 and visual origin is -48; final owner feel approval and production Stage XX integration remain pending. `tools/process_examiner_rework.py` extracts complete connected actors across source gutters, removes matte, applies one standing-reference scale, and packs binary-alpha cells. Runtime rows are down/right/left/up; action profiles mirror reviewed right poses, with the landing source's reversed rows corrected before packing. `tools/build_examiner_rework_frames.gd` owns the saved SpriteFrames; the legacy builder delegates to it. Visual observers preserve frame/progress during bounded wind-up retargeting and animate contacts at controller-owned damage boundaries. Grounded charge/Axiom travel use `move_and_collide`; lab walls match the existing 650x390 navigation rectangle. Sixteen original cues under `assets/audio/sfx/characters/disciples/examiner/rework/` observe state/contact or walk frames, stop on exit, and skip dummy headless playback. BossHealthHUD accepts boss-owned phase text; CombatHUD's default-on roster flag is disabled only in the lab. The Court owns exact 54-pixel wards and finite Descent damage; the director retains one music foundation and cinematic lifecycle. No presentation component gains progression/save authority.
- Decision 137 (2026-09-12) follows owner acceptance of the Examiner look with a dedicated four-pose alternating gait, turn-continuous footsteps, complete-source weapon extraction, repaired slam source, four eight-frame raster skill atlases, crimson danger decals, exact Descent safe-hole shading, and heavier fracture/beam audio. The 116 named clips, 192x160 cells, baseline 128, origin -48, controller timing, and trial authority remain intact. The owner accepted the skill effects but rejected the replacement walk identity. The identity follow-up now derives front/profile/back studies from isolated approved locomotion references, restores the narrow mask and long ivory coat, and matches helmet-to-ground body scale per direction. Skills, audio, HUD, and combat authority are unchanged; the owner approved the revised gait. Stage XX integration remains pending.
- Stage XX remains roadmap-only. No generic `god` exception, divine immunity, or final hierarchy should enter combat authority before a specific approved encounter contract requires it.

## Persistence

- `RunSession`, `StoryState`, `WeaponInventory`, `GearInventory`, `MaterialInventory`, `RecipeDiscovery`, and `LootState` own mutable session/profile domains.
- `SaveService` validates and atomically writes the versioned profile with backup recovery.
- Safe milestones are Sanctuary entry, equipment changes, and completed stage banking/chest claims. Active combat/waves are never serialized.
- Legacy version-1 weapon state migrates to King's default signature sword; archived player/shop content is not reconstructed.
- Debug F9 marks the session non-persistable before granting test progression, gear, materials, and cooldown relief.

## Asset Lifecycle

- `assets/` contains imported runtime files. `art_source/` contains generated/cleaned/review provenance.
- Reusable runtime/source identities use actor or purpose folders, never their first stage number. Stage-numbered directories are reserved for genuinely stage-specific composition/layout data. Existing stage-numbered Crag Bear art is tracked migration debt and remains runtime truth until every scene/resource/tool/catalog/test reference can move atomically.
- Future Disciple ownership is identity-based under `characters/disciples/<identity>`, with divine-order weapons/VFX and character audio in their own reusable purpose folders. Do not create the Executioner's empty runtime tree merely because her design is documented.
- `art_source/archive/` is ignored by Godot and may contain recoverable retired material, but runtime code/resources must never reference it.
- Cleanup requires reference-graph proof before an asset moves, followed by active-image reachability, editor import, and full smoke verification.

## Verification

- Active `tests/*_smoke.gd` scripts are the executable structural contract.
- `assisted_combat_targeting_smoke.gd` covers movement cancellation, single selection, repeated-click engagement, footprint picking, size-aware approach, a landed melee hit, and manual override.
- `ExpeditionDefeatReturn` owns production defeat exit: abort uncommitted loot, preserve `RunSession`, and request Sanctuary through `SceneTransition`; `expedition_defeat_return_smoke.gd` verifies the real transition and progression boundary.
- `StagePortal` owns proximity, a generated 16-frame full-surface vortex/deforming-rim layer, and an independent 16-frame lightning/particle layer. Its immutable tier table separately owns base/FX color, scale, speed, opacity, and FX reach: Normal disables lightning while higher threats progressively expand it. Encounter/stage data selects the tier from the destination threat, not the encounter just defeated. The current route contract is I->II Normal, II->III Mini Boss, III->IV Normal, IV->V Boss, V->VI Normal, and VI->Sanctuary Normal. Stage V keeps its chest/save ordering in `stage_5_flow.gd`, then uses one `NEXT_STAGE_PATH` constant to create the Stage VI portal. The selected presentation travels with the scene-change request so `SceneTransition` can mirror the tier in its blocking loading veil without gaining portal, encounter, or scene-choice authority.
- `auto_combat_smoke.gd` covers target cycling and real skill/cooldown use.
- `stagger_resistance_smoke.gd` covers weak unlimited flinch, Hog/Bear breakout thresholds, Boss immunity, Skill 1 versus Skill 3 scaling, continued damage during resistance, player action cancellation/knockback/recovery, invulnerability, and ability super armor.
- `runtime_archive_boundary_smoke.gd` guards the archive/runtime boundary.
- Run all active smoke scripts after cross-system cleanup; do not retain documentation references to tests moved into an archive.

## Examiner Stage XX direction (Decision 138)

Decision 138 (2026-09-12) supersedes the Stage VII optional-challenge and Stage XX direct-god placement: Examiner is the required Stage XX scenario boss, a false mentor serving the gods' manipulation. They promise reunion at Stage 100; King's family is actually dead. Souls, resurrection, replicas, the ending, and any bestowed power remain open possibilities, not established survival facts. The One Above's direct confrontation is now unscheduled. Only the F7 combat proof is playable; production route/outcome/reward/save integration is pending.

Decision 141 preserves the approved body art, living Sun charge, separate seal/stun rules, 60% Second Measure and 35% Unbound. Crimson Firmament retains its 180-point/3.8s interruptible charge, then releases 24 red meteors in eight randomized waves of three, 0.62s apart, with 0.90s warnings and 48px impact radii. Each wave snapshots King and scatters other impacts while leaving a nearby opening; no permanent safe column remains. Weighted legal attack selection discourages recent repetitions, and selected phase-two Axiom recoveries can lead into a newly warned, committed Reprisal. Seal breaks earn changing remarks. Lethal damage clears hazards, then Examiner kneels, rises, acknowledges King in a skippable conversation and withdraws. This is a rewardless F7 outcome preview: production Stage XX routing, rewards, story persistence and gear balance remain pending.

`HealthComponent.damage_absorber` optionally consumes a mitigated hit before HP mutation, emits `damage_absorbed`, and leaves ordinary health damage signals untouched. `ExaminerTrial` owns the seal pool, warned cuts, timeout and cancellation. The actor owns phase/state transitions, guard-break stun and its Sun lifetimes. `ExaminerSun` shares fixed ground destination/radius between warning and one-shot contact, passes overhead across props, and cleans up on owner death/reset. The HUD observes the separate seal bar. Court retains its dormant protection API and authoritative Verdict; Director owns dialogue/camera and one music foundation. New presentations reuse approved body poses. `DamageInfo.ignores_invulnerability` remains opt-in and explicit lab immunity remains absolute.

`ExaminerFirmament` owns a live RNG, optional reproducible test seed, per-wave target snapshots and bounded scatter around a nearby opening. Eight waves use the shared `ExaminerSun` warning/contact geometry. `ExaminerTactics` chooses only range/phase/cooldown-legal moves and tracks four recent choices; movement and damage remain actor-owned. Lethal damage emits victory lifecycle signals after clearing Sun, lane and trial authority. Director owns the skippable outro and camera/input restoration; its binding revision rejects stale callbacks after reset. `encounter_completed` is an in-session hook, not a save or reward transaction. The actor owns the berserk gate, charge seal, cooldown, committed barrage and death/reset cleanup. `ExaminerEnergyPresentation` composes the independent sixteen-frame core, inward streams and persistent aura. Warning and impact geometry remain shared with Sun authority; camera pulse and audio gains limit simultaneous red impacts.

### King greatsword and bounded mastery (Decision 143)

`SwordComboDefinition` owns three steps and grace time; `MeleeAttackComponent` owns step selection, one-hit damage rolls, timers, cancellation and equipment-scaled phases. Both current essences share the authored cleave shape. The existing Player buffer owns pending input. `KingMasteryComponent` observes accepted hits/casts and applies per-cast weapon-power modifiers through `AbilityComponent.amplify_committed_cast`; shared resources are immutable. Its Resolve and landing-link timers are session-local, pause naturally and clear on defeat.

`king_greatsword_animation.gd` retains the shared player animation interface and specializes named frame phases. `king_greatsword_effects.gd` observes those phases/strikes, clips generated contact textures to real shapes, displays pips, and plays original cues. `king_contact_burst.gd` is finite presentation only. Existing skill components still own ground targets, traversal, radial collision and damage. Equipment movement speed adjusts stride cadence through events.

The September 13 presentation review gives RiftbreakVisual sole ownership of its full impact/residual sequence; the generic contact observer skips this skill. It captures the already-placed hitbox world point on contact, survives recovery, and fades without following the actor. Pursuit's definition uses zero world-space ground offset, while Riftbreak retains the local +16 compensation for AbilityPivot at -16: these are different coordinate contracts. Both floor sprites and Pursuit's shockwave use zero local offset at their captured world contact. Reaction entry resets presentation speed after equipment-adjusted locomotion. The current body atlas importer packs the approved sweep and front/back gait corrections, rejects bad source recovery poses, and removes dark matte fringes. `tools/audit_king_animation_frames.gd` renders every installed frame with fixed origin/baseline guides.

`ProgressionDefinition` owns the initial stage cap and flag/cap arrays. `PlayerProgressionComponent` computes the current cap from StoryState, discards newly awarded excess XP, preserves earned legacy levels, and emits changes when story gates unlock. RunSession/SaveService formats are unchanged; no new saved passive state. F9 keeps its existing save suppression and bypasses stage ceilings.

### King evolving collection (Decision 144)

`KingSkillLibrary` owns learned availability, rank selection, ten-slot assignment and Lab preview state. Each player owns explicit copies of slot resources; ability definitions resolve to that player's exact component. `RunSession.king_skill_slots` stores optional unique stable IDs; absent/empty fields retain legacy-save compatibility. Only Sanctuary equip requests save. Invalid/unlearned restored choices do not grant future skills. Preview ranks and the pre-preview loadout are local to the Lab player.

`KingOathDefinition` configures immutable family/rank timelines. `KingOathComponent` owns short cast phases, Crosscut contact windows and Breakstep movement/protection. `king_oath_ground_attack.gd` owns released ground contacts with immutable tuning/damage/critical/world-point snapshots. It persists through cast completion and cancels on caster defeat/scene teardown. `king_oath_area_hitbox.gd` selects one core/rim tier and applies Griefwake rim slow only to Light-tier enemy movement. Player enumerates all ability components for active state, cancellation, buffering and debug cooldown cleanup. `KingMasteryComponent` and `CombatFeedbackPresenter` bind all components. Milestone changes defer definition replacement until casts finish. The actor still owns wall-controlled displacement and incoming interruption.

`king_oath_presentation.gd` observes phases/contacts with finite raster bursts, movement echoes and bounded SFX voices. It has no damage or movement authority. The skill collection is a paused CanvasLayer shared by CharacterMenu and CombatLab; it restores only its own pause. Detached `SkillBarSlot` observers disconnect cooldown signals immediately, allowing same-frame swap and cast without stale timers.

### Responsive core and slot migration (Decision 147)

`KingRiposteComponent` observes blocked incoming hits during Breakstep, excludes debug immunity and dodge-piercing damage, and primes one accepted basic attack. MeleeAttackComponent resets its per-attack damage/animation modifiers before attack_started; riposte may then modify that committed action without mutating weapon resources. Breakstep completion supplies the existing mastery link; its non-damaging activation preserves Resolve.

SkillLoadoutDefinition.SLOT_COUNT owns the ten-slot boundary. KingSkillCatalog accepts absent/empty, legacy four-entry and ten-entry arrays; nonempty IDs must be unique and known. KingSkillLibrary expands old selections, filters unlearned powers and owns explicit empty slots. Core preset/individual changes save only in Sanctuary; Lab state remains local. AUTO SKILL scans all ten but does not automatically spend Breakstep. GroundPointTargeting optionally draws the core boundary exposed by an ability; it has no damage authority.
